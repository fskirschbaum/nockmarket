#### A (**No**)de.js Sto(**ck**) (**Market**) Web Application
---

Based on the application outlined in the **SitePoint Book Jump Start Node.js** by *Don Nguyen*.

###Huh?

I have made some modifications such as upgrading some of the packages to more current iterations as well as improving the overall look and feel of the app by making it more responsive. You can check out my version [here](http://fskirschbaum-nockmarket.herokuapp.com).

I picked this ebook up for free and decided to work my way through it. I am running a MacBook Pro Retina with OS X 10.9 Mavericks and ran into various issues with some of the information in the book being out a bit out of date since its publication in *2012*, an eternity by all rights and regards.

As I worked through it I decided to update my code as I went and when I was done I decided to improve it further to give me more learning opportunity along the way.

I figured there was a chance that others might encounter the same problems along their way as well and decided to dump everything here. Since I'd already `git push heroku master`'d it, it seemed like a trivial thing to also push it up to GitHub as well.

###Verdict?

Overall I have to say that I enjoyed this project. I was already sold on Node.js before jumping into this but I did like the approachable way the book runs through code to help you dive into the wonderful world of Node.js. I would recommend this for anyone looking to try out node without a lot of barrier to entry, anyone that learns better by doing, and anyone who already has some experience developing in some capacity.

A word of warning, however, is that this book tackles a lot of different topics along the way and sometimes the author glosses a bit over things in the interest of keeping pace with producing a useful product. For example, Backbone.js makes an appearence in this text but there is almost *no* explanation of what you're really tackling by using that library. I think the reasons are obvious when you bear in mind that this is a book about getting a jump start on Node.js and not a tome on full life-cycle development of a web application for both front- and back-end. He does take the time, however, to point out resources that will help you get a deeper understanding of pretty much everything along the way giving you the opportunity to dive deeper if you want.

###License Information(?)

I do not own any of this code and to be honest I didn't get any indication from the book that there were any license restrictions, however, I assume it's best not to use this code as-is on your production project. So, if you have questions about the license, use, and copyright of the code contained herein, you're probably better off asking the book's author.

####What's next?

I plan to poke at this this a bit more going forward. Mainly, I want to implement a bit more account management, toy with updating the password security, maybe a logout button, perhaps do some more with the public stocks, improve the filtering and anything else that I feel like playing around with.

Maybe...

#####Heaps of Praise? Burning Hatred?

If you like what I've done or feel that I am someone *wrong* on the **internet** and need to be put in my place, you can reach out to me here or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fskirschbaum). I make no promises on how I'll respond, though, but I'm usually a relatively pleasant person.

To be clear, though, I make no promises that what I've done here is perfect or could not have been achieved better. I'm sure there are bound to be problems with my code. If you see something you think I could have done better, feel free to let me know (in a constructive way) as I'm always looking for feedback to help me learn and grow as a developer.
